# Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals

This repository contains my code for the course `Neo4j & LLM Fundamentals` on [GraphAcademy](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/llm-fundamentals/).

## Course Description

In this course, you will learn how to integrate Neo4j with Generative AI models using [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/).

You will learn why graph databases are a reliable option for grounding Large Language Models (LLMs), using Neo4j to provide factual, reliable information to stop the LLM from giving false information, also known as **hallucination**.

You will use [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) and Python to interact with an LLM and Neo4j. Langchain provides a robust basis for AI application development and comes with Neo4j integrations for Cypher and Vector Indexes.

This course focuses on [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), although Langchain allows you to work with the LLM of your choice.
